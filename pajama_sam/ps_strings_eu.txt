\x7FT4164204,13424\x7FHey, a board.
\x7FT4177628,19535\x7FIt's too far to reach.
\x7FT4197163,10285\x7FI can't reach it.

\x7FT4274655,45479\x7FUh oh.  I hope that nice tree's not too mad that I lost her rope.
\x7FT4320134,22471\x7FAt least I got this great piece of wood.
\x7FT4342605,44584\x7FBoy!  I had no idea my closet was this BIG on the inside.

\x7FT5921272,51478\x7FMr. Tree?  Um, I'm sorry, but, I, uh, I lost the rope you let me borrow.
\x7FT5972750,27104\x7FRope?  Oh, that's all right, I can probably get a new one.
\x7FT5999854,8473\x7FYou're not mad?
\x7FT6008327,34603\x7FNo, actually, it's kind of a relief not to have to hold that rope up all day long.
\x7FT6229194,13769\x7FUh... thanks.
\x7FT6242963,15632\x7FYou can borrow that, if you like.
\x7FT6258595,21947\x7FI feel bad about you losing your things.
\x7FT6280542,37705\x7FYeah, how am I supposed to capture Darkness without all of my stuff?
\x7FT6318247,31445\x7FWell, I'm sure your things are here in the Land of Darkness somewhere.
\x7FT6349692,25824\x7FIf you look around you might be able to find them again.
\x7FT6375516,36169\x7FI hope so.  I'll bring you back your rope later, OK?
\x7FT6411685,6061\x7FGood luck.

\x7FT4487874,8698\x7FHi.  How are you doing?
\x7FT4496572,16425\x7FPretty good.  How about you?
\x7FT4512997,8347\x7FI can't complain.
\x7FT4521344,8921\x7FThat's good.
\x7FT4530265,11732\x7FIt's against the rules.
\x7FT4541997,4272\x7FOh.
\x7FT4546269,13235\x7FHello Sam.  What's new?
\x7FT4559504,7408\x7FHi tree.
\x7FT4566912,33897\x7FYou know, I really enjoy a nice piece of cheese now and again.
\x7FT4600809,15808\x7FCheese is awfully tasty.
\x7FT4616617,8273\x7FIndeed.
\x7FT4624890,12792\x7FBut I'm lactose intolerent.
\x7FT4637682,4425\x7FOh.
\x7FT4642107,11016\x7FHi.  How are you doing?
\x7FT4653123,11768\x7FOK, I guess.
\x7FT4664891,33993\x7FI can't seem to get up into Darkness's treehouse, though.
\x7FT4698884,27020\x7FI think there are baskets in front that go right up into it.
\x7FT4725904,44777\x7FExcept I can't get the baskets in front of Darkness's treehouse to work.
\x7FT4770681,36927\x7FThey work on weight.
\x7FT4807608,60073\x7FExcept that silly boat by the river thinks wood sinks in water and won't take me for a ride.
\x7FT4867681,29004\x7FMaybe you could show him that wood doesn't sink in water?
\x7FT4896685,34953\x7FI can't get past the big spiky hedge in the garden, though.
\x7FT4931638,26091\x7FMaybe you should find a way around it, instead.
\x7FT4957729,62889\x7FBut there's this stream underground, and the current is too strong for me and Otto the boat to get where we want to go.
\x7FT5020618,26704\x7FMaybe you should find something to help Otto paddle.
\x7FT5047322,26441\x7FExcept I keep turning visible too soon.
\x7FT5073763,8135\x7FToo soon?
\x7FT5081898,23820\x7FMaybe you should find a quicker way to get where you're going.
\x7FT5105718,51433\x7FBut there's this winch thing down in the mines that I want to fix, and I can't figure out how to do it.
\x7FT5157151,17377\x7FWhat's wrong with it?
\x7FT5174528,20796\x7FMaybe you could find a replacement part somewhere.
\x7FT5195324,65448\x7FBut Darkness's living room furniture stops moving every time they see me, so I can't get my mask back.
\x7FT5260772,26178\x7FWhat if you somehow fixed it so they can't see you?
\x7FT5286950,65833\x7FBut there's this place I want to go down in the mines, and instead of a passageway, there's just a bunch of dots.
\x7FT5352783,44836\x7FDots, eh?
\x7FT5397619,29822\x7FThey probably got stuck on the plans somehow.
\x7FT5427441,32587\x7FI bet if you finished them, the Crew could get back to work.
\x7FT5460028,35241\x7FBut I'm trying to get into this shack and it doesn't have a doorknob.
\x7FT5495269,33549\x7FReally?
\x7FT5528818,61161\x7FI found my Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox, but it's underwater and I can't reach it.
\x7FT5589979,16336\x7FDid you say it was METAL?
\x7FT5606315,52329\x7FI still can't get my Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox out of the water.
\x7FT5658644,12726\x7FDid you say it was metal?
\x7FT5671370,6833\x7FYes?
\x7FT5678203,20726\x7FMaybe you can fish it out with a magnet.
\x7FT5698929,54913\x7FExcept I'm trying to rescue a bunch of carrots and I can't convince the refrigerator to open.
\x7FT5753842,25449\x7FIt says it has to keep the prisoners in there.
\x7FT5779291,61291\x7FWell, if you can't get it to open to get the prisoners OUT, maybe you could get it to open to let another one IN.
\x7FT5840582,22559\x7FDid you find your super hero stuff yet?
\x7FT5863141,32909\x7FYeah, so I suppose I should go capture Darkness now.
\x7FT5896050,14314\x7FNo, I'm still looking.
\x7FT5910364,10908\x7FBest of luck.
\x7FT6042930,25577\x7FI feel kind of bad about losing your rope.
\x7FT6068507,24488\x7FWould you like to have this piece of wood instead?
\x7FT6092995,12470\x7FEEEEEK !!!
\x7FT6105465,19945\x7FTake it away! Take it away!
\x7FT6125410,5622\x7FPheeew!
\x7FT6125410,5622\x7FPheeew!
\x7FT6131032,14632\x7FThat wouldn't be very friendly.
\x7FT6145664,18809\x7FI'm not finished with the rope yet.
\x7FT6164473,28073\x7FI can't get over there.  I'm tied to a tree!
\x7FT6192546,36648\x7FI wonder what Pajama Man would do in a situation like this?
\x7FT6417746,13928\x7FWhoooooaa!
\x7FT6431674,31670\x7FCustoms!  Customs inspection!
\x7FT4387189,34294\x7FWell, well, what have we here?
\x7FT4421483,66391\x7FLooks like a flashlight and a Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox!
\x7FT4387189,34294\x7FWell, well, well, what have we here?
\x7FT4421483,66391\x7FLooks like a flashlight and a Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man Lunchbox!
\x7FT6463344,51528\x7FDid you declare these before entering the Land of Darkness, young man?
\x7FT6514872,42793\x7FDeclare?  Well, no, I guess not. I...
\x7FT6557665,56314\x7FI think we'd better confiscate these items, they could be dangerous.
\x7FT6613979,36146\x7FAnd you're travelling in disguise!
\x7FT6650125,37647\x7FLet's see what you look like.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT6687772,25069\x7FPajama Sam, eh?
\x7FT6712841,96596\x7FWell, all right then, Pajama Sam, you can go, but I've got my eye on you!
\x7FT6809437,30217\x7FUh oh.  Now what do I do?
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!

\x7FT6839654,58089\x7FThat scary-looking place up there must be Darkness's house.
no enter costume for room %d
\x7FT6897743,21961\x7FIt says 'Dark's House'.
\x7FT6919704,21128\x7FIt says 'Boat Dock'.
\x7FT6940832,19513\x7FIt says 'Mines'.
\x7FT6960345,18888\x7FThat's Darkness's house.
\x7FT6979233,23144\x7FThat looks like Darkness's house.

\x7FT8925467,11097\x7FLet's go sailing.
\x7FT8936564,46571\x7FWell, technically we can't do that since I'm not a sailboat because I don't have a sail.
\x7FT8983135,54777\x7FI know what you mean, but technically, you should say, 'let's go floating,' or something like that.
\x7FT9037912,39849\x7FSure, sure, whatever you say. Let's go sailing.
\x7FT9077761,6323\x7FOK.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT9084084,14457\x7FThanks for the lift, Otto.
\x7FT9098541,31041\x7FNo problem.  I can float now, you know...
\x7FT9129582,8847\x7FBye Otto.
\x7FT9138429,21004\x7FBye Otto, I'll be back soon.
\x7FT9138429,21004\x7FBye Otto, I'll be back soon.
\x7FT9159433,27833\x7FOkay, I'll leave the meter running.
\x7FT9187266,4459\x7F)Huh?
\x7FT9191725,43012\x7FWell, um, I had this friend and he's a taxi and...
\x7FT9234737,23252\x7FOkay, bye bye now bye bye.
\x7FT9257989,17963\x7FOkay, I'll wait here.

Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8164155,25992\x7FOk, check this out. It's wood, right?
\x7FT8190147,10541\x7FYes.
\x7FT8200688,17272\x7FAll right, now watch.
\x7FT8217960,30728\x7FSee?  It floats. Wood floats.
\x7FT8248688,8836\x7FYeah...
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8257524,32216\x7FSo you'll float, too! Go on, give it a try.
\x7FT8289740,12321\x7FI guess...
\x7FT8302061,21139\x7FSo far, so good.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8323200,19964\x7FWell, here goes nothing!
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8343164,25505\x7FI'm doing it! I'm floating!
\x7FT8368669,13649\x7FYahoo!
\x7FT8382318,20650\x7FBoy, this is great!
\x7FT8402968,14723\x7FCan I give you a ride somewhere?
\x7FT8417691,14748\x7FC'mon, hop in!
\x7FT8432439,19305\x7FJust an old piece of wood, why?
\x7FT8451744,30169\x7FHey, what was that you just threw into the water?
\x7FT8481913,21666\x7FIt's floating!
\x7FT8503579,20818\x7FWood floats in water!
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8524397,20553\x7FSure.  Didn't you know that?
\x7FT8544950,13500\x7FYou're a BOAT.
\x7FT8558450,164615\x7FI had this friend who told me about someone he know who was wood and who sank in the water...
\x7FT8723065,17323\x7FSo far, so good.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8740388,16874\x7FWell, here goes nothing!
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8343164,25505\x7FI'm doing it! I'm floating!
\x7FT8757262,20843\x7FYahoo!
\x7FT8778105,24577\x7FBoy, this is great!
\x7FT8802682,13067\x7FMy name's Otto.
\x7FT8815749,17536\x7FCan I give you a ride somewhere?
\x7FT8833285,23912\x7FThank's Otto. My name's sam.
\x7FT8857197,13983\x7FPleased to meet you Sam.
\x7FT8871180,13954\x7FC'mon, hop in!
\x7FT9275952,21377\x7FI'll give the oars to Otto when we need them.
\x7FT9297329,28683\x7FI'll just wait and give these oars to Otto when we need them.
\x7FT9326012,15307\x7FOtto doesn't need the oars now.
\x7FT9341319,24885\x7FOtto doesn't need the oars right at this moment.
\x7FT7002377,5384\x7FHi!
\x7FT7007761,6778\x7FHello.
\x7FT7014539,77608\x7FMy name's Sam. I'm going to capture Darkness and put him in a metal lunchbox. After I find my lunchbox, I mean.
\x7FT7092147,37595\x7FPleased to meet you, Sam. You can call me Otto.
\x7FT7129742,12153\x7FHi again, Otto.
\x7FT7141895,9812\x7FHello Sam.
\x7FT7151707,15112\x7FNice weather we're having, eh?
\x7FT7166819,9782\x7FUm, yeah.
\x7FT7176601,15544\x7FGreat day for a swim, eh?
\x7FT7192145,14098\x7FYeah, whatever.
\x7FT7206243,39464\x7FHave you seen my Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox?
\x7FT7245707,9102\x7FUm, no.
\x7FT7254809,9976\x7FI like cheese.
\x7FT7264785,12590\x7FHey, who doesn't?
\x7FT7277375,18184\x7FAre you sure you won't give me a lift?
\x7FT7295559,30762\x7FNo, I can't go in the water or I'll sink.
\x7FT7326321,18857\x7FBut I'm telling you, wood floats!
\x7FT7345178,18615\x7FI wish I could believe you.
\x7FT7363793,55573\x7FI think some of my Pajama Sam stuff might be on the other side of the river and I can't swim that far.
\x7FT7419366,30333\x7FBut I can't float, I'm made of wood.
\x7FT7449699,27098\x7FExactly, wood floats in water.
\x7FT7476797,43513\x7FYeah right.  Next you'll be telling me that birds can fly.
\x7FT7520310,9871\x7FOh brother.
\x7FT7530181,29967\x7FI really need your help to get across the river.
\x7FT7560148,15001\x7FI'm made of wood.
\x7FT7575149,25064\x7FLook, I'm telling you, wood floats!
\x7FT7600213,35193\x7FBut, I had this friend, and, um, he told me...
\x7FT7635406,11159\x7FI know, I know.
\x7FT7646565,28399\x7FLook, everybody knows wood floats!
\x7FT7674964,12373\x7FI don't believe you.
\x7FT7687337,32361\x7FYou've got to believe me, wood floats in water!
\x7FT7719698,25130\x7FI'm not getting in unless you prove it.
\x7FT7744828,24775\x7FI'll give you some cheese if you give me a lift.
\x7FT7769603,22666\x7FYou don't have any cheese!
\x7FT7792269,6626\x7FOh yeah.
\x7FT7798895,41129\x7FHi! My name's Sam. I'm here to capture Darness.
\x7FT7840024,32082\x7FPleased to meet you, Sam. You can call me Otto.
\x7FT7872106,18761\x7FWould you give me a ride across the river?
\x7FT7890867,13073\x7FOh, no.
\x7FT7903940,12793\x7FBut wood floats!
\x7FT7916733,38860\x7FI can't go in the water. I'd sink! I'm made of wood, you know.
\x7FT7955593,14744\x7FNo, I don't think so.
\x7FT7970337,85267\x7FI had this friend and he told me this story about his dentist's brother, um...
\x7FT8055604,6207\x7FReally.
\x7FT8061811,44550\x7FStraight to the bottom. It's so scary. I wish I'd been a car.
\x7FT8106361,17369\x7FI think your friend was wrong.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8123730,18978\x7FWood floats in the water.
\x7FT8142708,21447\x7FOh, I wish that were true.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT8885134,8296\x7FThanks, Otto.
\x7FT8893430,12189\x7FAnytime, Sam.
\x7FT8905619,19848\x7FI don't want him to spring a leak.

\x7FT9447592,21096\x7FRats, there's nothing in here at all.
\x7FT9468688,24232\x7FUh, oh.  I think I'm stuck.
\x7FT9492920,24680\x7FYes, I'm definitely stuck.
\x7FT9517600,26473\x7FI wonder how Pajama Man would handle this?
\x7FT9544073,15623\x7FWho-o-o-o-a

\x7FT10422016,4895\x7FHmph!
\x7FT10426911,18422\x7FTrees only.
\x7FT10445333,18120\x7FA lot of my friends are trees.
\x7FT10463453,12222\x7FReally?
\x7FT10475675,28521\x7FI know the tree across the river who holds the rope.
\x7FT10504196,16484\x7FNice try.
\x7FT10520680,36832\x7FI'm afraid we simply can't let you pass unless you're a tree.
\x7FT10557512,15016\x7FCouldn't I, please...?
\x7FT10572528,20187\x7FYou don't look like a tree to me.
\x7FT10800889,15737\x7FErrr, tree coming through.
\x7FT10816626,27023\x7FGood day to you, fellow tree.
\x7FT10843649,13145\x7FGood day fellow tree.
\x7FT10856794,25826\x7FAnd a good day to you as well.
\x7FT10816626,27023\x7FGood day to you, fellow tree.

\x7FT9766375,16097\x7FGood fortune to you.
\x7FT9782472,13369\x7FThank you, fellow tree.
\x7FT9795841,19817\x7FErrr, tree coming through.
\x7FT9815658,25974\x7FGood day to you, fellow tree.
\x7FT9841632,13561\x7FGood day fellow tree.
\x7FT9855193,21233\x7FAnd a good day to you as well.
\x7FT9876426,7098\x7FHalt!
\x7FT9883524,20239\x7FJust where do you think you are going?
\x7FT9903763,29416\x7FUm, nowhere really, I just wanted to pass by.
\x7FT9933179,20597\x7FJust barging through like that?
\x7FT9953776,26707\x7FWithout even asking permission?
\x7FT9980483,17906\x7FHave you no manners?
\x7FT9998389,22125\x7FIt is customary to ...
\x7FT10020514,38083\x7FOh no, this isn't another customs inspection, is it?
\x7FT10058597,17027\x7FAre you going to take all my stuff?
\x7FT10075624,30471\x7FI assure you, we have no interest in your 'stuff'.
\x7FT10106095,8947\x7FPheeeeeeeeeeeeeeew.
\x7FT10115042,35007\x7FThat's a relief.  I'm sorry if I offended you.  May I pass through?
\x7FT10150049,7315\x7FNo.
\x7FT10157364,7897\x7FNo?!
\x7FT10165261,22267\x7FThis is an EXCLUSIVE road!
\x7FT10187528,26588\x7FIt's for TREES ONLY!
\x7FT10214116,27138\x7FYes, trees only.
\x7FT10241254,23043\x7FNow be off with you!
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT10592715,23081\x7FViolence is never a good solution.
\x7FT10615796,4768\x7FHi!
\x7FT10620564,9256\x7FMy name's Sam.
\x7FT10629820,20656\x7FHow nice.
\x7FT10650476,36383\x7FI'm going to capture Darkness and put him in my lunchbox!
\x7FT10686859,42264\x7FYes, well, why don't you run along and play then?
\x7FT10729123,28826\x7FWe have important tree business to discuss.
\x7FT10757949,16230\x7FDo you guys know Otto the Boat?
\x7FT10774179,6495\x7FHmph!!!
\x7FT10780674,20215\x7FI should say not!
\x7FT10882620,28904\x7FHave you guys met each other?  Your neighbors!
\x7FT10911524,44074\x7FLofty, high-top elitist bourgeois pigs! You're vegetables too, you know!
\x7FT10955598,28840\x7FMaybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.
\x7FT10984438,10073\x7FRIFF-RAFF!
\x7FT10994511,17688\x7FI could make it worth your while...
\x7FT11012199,7596\x7FHmph!
\x7FT11019795,32171\x7FAs though we would have any use.
%d
\x7FT11051966,31529\x7FI guess I better put my ingenious disguise back on.
\x7FT11083495,7277\x7FW-H-O-A !
\x7FT11090772,25961\x7FIs that my Pajama Sam mask?
\x7FT11116733,21162\x7FThis mask belongs to the PEOPLE!
\x7FT11137895,19446\x7FIt sure looks like my mask.
\x7FT11157341,16554\x7FProperty is theft man.
\x7FT11173895,68641\x7FAnyway, I need the mask to protect my identity as the leader of the Salad Liberation Front.
\x7FT11242536,7430\x7FThe what?
\x7FT11249966,19642\x7FThe Salad Liberation Front.
\x7FT11269608,29924\x7FWe're a group of vegetables fighting against the course system.
\x7FT11299532,21548\x7FWe're tired of being relegated to the salad.
\x7FT11321080,22282\x7FWe want to be the main course.
\x7FT11343362,24408\x7FWhatever, I just want my mask back.
\x7FT11367770,54390\x7FI'll tell you what, the other carrots are being held prisoner in the refrigerator in Darkness's kitchen.
\x7FT11422160,32489\x7FIf you help me free the carrots, I'll give you back the mask.
\x7FT11454649,13115\x7FOK, it's a deal.
\x7FT11467764,9833\x7FOK, sure!
\x7FT11477597,4706\x7FGreat !!!
\x7FT11482303,32103\x7FI'll come with you to the kitchen so I can direct the operation.
\x7FT11514406,5760\x7FNeat!
\x7FT11520166,19963\x7FOw!  Hey quit that!
\x7FT11540129,6489\x7FSorry.
Restoring Sam...
\x7FT11546618,35433\x7FI can't get to it through all these plants with big thorns on them.
\x7FT11582051,38249\x7FI wish I had super-tough skin like Pajama Man.
\x7FT11620300,47785\x7FYoo hoo!  I can't get over there, could you toss me my lunchbox?
\x7FT11668085,18089\x7FI guess no one can hear me.
\x7FT11686174,50601\x7FIt's my lunchbox, all right, but this big thorny hedge is keeping me from getting over there.
\x7FT11736775,59817\x7FWhy would anybody put a dangerous, ugly hedge like this in between me and my lunchbox?
\x7FT11796592,23144\x7FI've got to get my lunchbox over there.
\x7FT11819736,15977\x7FMaybe there's a way around.
\x7FT11835713,30888\x7FThere's no way I can get through these sharp thorns.
\x7FT11866601,22905\x7FThat's my lunchbox over there by the well.
\x7FT11889506,13912\x7FIt's my lunchbox.
\x7FT11546618,35433\x7FI can't get to it through all these plants with big thorns on them.
\x7FT11903418,41458\x7FThat's my Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox.
\x7FT11944876,19732\x7FI need to get my lunchbox.
\x7FT11964608,19177\x7FPhew!  It's hot in there!
\x7FT11983785,47657\x7FHey! That's my Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox over there!
no enter costume for room %d
switched to BEACHED-ROOT????????????????????????
\x7FT9275952,21377\x7FI'll give the oars to Otto when we need them.
\x7FT9297329,28683\x7FI'll just wait and give these oars to Otto when we need them.
\x7FT9326012,15307\x7FOtto doesn't need the oars now.
\x7FT9341319,24885\x7FOtto doesn't need the oars right at this moment.
\x7FT12031442,6847\x7FHere you go.
\x7FT12038289,15752\x7FThis should be at least a pound.
\x7FT12054041,16278\x7FAll right, you're clear.
\x7FT12070319,12227\x7FGo on across.
\x7FT12082546,9561\x7FHold it, you.
\x7FT12092107,9377\x7FMy name's Sam.
\x7FT12101484,50225\x7FI'm looking for my Pajama Sam stuff and I'd like to see if any of it is across the bridge.
\x7FT12151709,20632\x7FDon't try to get friendly with me.
\x7FT12172341,35303\x7FIf you want to go across, you'll have to pay a toll.
\x7FT12207644,16241\x7FHow much is the toll?
\x7FT12223885,17481\x7FOne pound of gold.
\x7FT12241366,6332\x7FHold it!
\x7FT12247698,23820\x7FThat'll cost you a pound of gold.
\x7FT12271518,7448\x7FOh, yeah.
\x7FT12278966,14107\x7FNot so fast!
\x7FT12293073,26841\x7FNobody sneaks across without paying.
\x7FT12319914,11128\x7FUm, sorry.
\x7FT12331042,31945\x7FWhy do people have to pay a toll just to cross a bridge?
\x7FT12362987,22212\x7FTo get to the other side, of course.
\x7FT12385199,16303\x7FRules are rules.
\x7FT12401502,32127\x7FYou're not some kind of troublemaker, are you?
\x7FT12433629,11849\x7FNo sir, not me.
\x7FT12445478,39977\x7FDon't you think a whole pound of gold is kind of a lot for a bridge toll?
\x7FT12485455,19733\x7FSupply and demand.
\x7FT12505188,55842\x7FThis is the only way to get over to the park, so take it or leave it, know what I mean?
\x7FT12561030,9289\x7FI guess so.
\x7FT12570319,79529\x7FWhat's to stop someone else from putting up another bridge here, charging less than a pound of gold to go across, and driving you out of business?
\x7FT12649848,19247\x7FHey, what's going on here?
\x7FT12669095,29230\x7FYou trying to weasel in on my territory?
\x7FT12698325,16548\x7FI wouldn't advise it.
\x7FT12714873,13906\x7FI've got friends.
\x7FT12728779,18883\x7FPowerful friends.
\x7FT12747662,6569\x7FI see.
\x7FT12754231,4389\x7FWhat?
\x7FT12758620,7252\x7FWhere?
\x7FT12765872,44969\x7FThere's a construction crew headed this way with a bunch of bricks and mortar and stuff.
\x7FT12810841,9689\x7FJust kidding.
\x7FT12820530,11613\x7FThat's not funny.
\x7FT12832143,12993\x7FDon't do that again.
\x7FT12845136,19369\x7FHi!  I'm Sam.
\x7FT12864505,28916\x7FI'd like to cross the bridge to see what's on the other side.
\x7FT12893421,21033\x7FDon't try to butter me up.
\x7FT12914454,29864\x7FIf you want to go across, you'll have to pay a toll.
\x7FT12944318,13205\x7FHow much is the toll?
\x7FT12957523,18160\x7FOne pound of gold.
\x7FT12975683,8373\x7FHold it!
\x7FT12984056,39090\x7FIf you're planning on coming back, I'll need to stamp your hand.
\x7FT13023146,10833\x7FOh, OK.
\x7FT13033979,32977\x7FYou wouldn't believe how many people try to cheat me.
\x7FT13066956,6491\x7FThanks.
\x7FT13073447,42475\x7FHmm.  I guess that's a legitimate stamp.  Go on ahead.
\x7FT13115922,20463\x7FYou don't remember me from before?
\x7FT13136385,43980\x7FSure, but you could be somebody else pretending to be you.
\x7FT13180365,6463\x7FMm.
\x7FT13186828,9415\x7FHavarti.
\x7FT13196243,11816\x7FI'm fine, how are you?
\x7FT13208059,31507\x7FNo no no.  I said 'Havarti'.
\x7FT13239566,36841\x7FDon't you know how to play 'Cheese and Crackers?'
\x7FT13276407,23456\x7FMom told me not to play with my food.
\x7FT13299863,24244\x7FMom told me I shouldn't play with my food.
\x7FT13324107,41042\x7FNo, 'Cheese and Crackers' is the name of a game, see?
\x7FT13365149,17555\x7FCome on, I'll show you how to play.
\x7FT13382704,23529\x7FWhat did that word mean that you said before?
\x7FT13406233,21545\x7FWhat did that word that you said before mean?
\x7FT13427778,7461\x7F'Havarti?'
\x7FT13435239,55345\x7FThat's what you say when you want to play Cheese and Crackers with someone.
\x7FT13490584,52003\x7FAnd then if they want to play too they say 'Provolone' back to you.
\x7FT13542587,7641\x7FOh, I get it.
\x7FT13550228,6593\x7FHavarti!
\x7FT13556821,11295\x7FProvolone!
\x7FT13550228,6593\x7FHavarti!
\x7FT13556821,11295\x7FProvolone!
\x7FT13568116,29065\x7FThis pencil says, 'Construction Crew' on it.
\x7FT13597181,7930\x7FThat's right!
\x7FT13605111,44566\x7FI'm the most important member of the Land of Darkness Construction Crew.
\x7FT13649677,23202\x7FWithout me they wouldn't know what to do.
\x7FT13672879,58793\x7FIf you're so important, why are you hanging around in the park instead of working with the Construction Crew?
\x7FT13731672,19947\x7FI'd rather not talk about it.
\x7FT13751619,16969\x7FWant to come along with me for a while?
\x7FT13768588,57475\x7FSure, it has to be more exciting than sitting around waiting for one of these old loafers to make a move.
\x7FT13826063,11049\x7FAll right!
%d
\x7FT13837112,9801\x7FHmmm....
\x7FT13846913,12739\x7FHmmm....
\x7FT14289046,18202\x7FI already oiled the door!
\x7FT14307248,14441\x7FI already did that.
no enter costume for room %d
\x7FT9275952,21377\x7FI'll give the oars to Otto when we need them.
\x7FT9297329,28683\x7FI'll just wait and give these oars to Otto when we need them.
\x7FT9326012,15307\x7FOtto doesn't need the oars now.
\x7FT9341319,24885\x7FOtto doesn't need the oars right at this moment.
\x7FT13859652,18553\x7FThat wouldn't be very nice.
\x7FT13878205,13721\x7FThat might get me in trouble.
\x7FT13891926,10305\x7FIt's an oil can.
\x7FT13902231,14173\x7FAnd there's some oil in it!
\x7FT13916404,15137\x7FHey, that's nire linterna!
\x7FT13931541,15253\x7Fnire linterna's in there!
\x7FT13946794,25321\x7FI can't open this door, there's no knob on it!
\x7FT13972115,18553\x7FThere's nothing for me to grab on to.
\x7FT13990668,27049\x7FWhoever heard of a door without a knob, anyway?
\x7FT14017717,26409\x7FI think I need to find another knob for this door.
\x7FT14044126,17258\x7FThe door is stuck!
\x7FT14061384,15913\x7FI think the hinges are rusty.
\x7FT14077297,28559\x7FI can't open the door, the hinges are rusty.
\x7FT14105856,32233\x7FThere must be some way I can fix these rusty hinges.
\x7FT14138089,21321\x7FThe hinges are really rusty.
\x7FT14159410,24841\x7FSomebody should oil them so they work better.
\x7FT14184251,19201\x7FThis doorknob should fit the door!
\x7FT14203452,45224\x7FOnce again, Pajama Sam saves the day with his mighty brain.
\x7FT14248676,28873\x7FThese hinges look kind of rusty. I'd better oil them.
\x7FT14248676,28873\x7FThese hinges look kind of rusty. I'd better oil them.
\x7FT14277549,11497\x7FThat did the trick.
%d
\x7FT14321689,12473\x7Fnire linterna!
\x7FT14334162,12153\x7FAll right!
\x7FT14346315,22441\x7FI have all my Pajama Sam stuff!
\x7FT14368756,23240\x7FNow I can go after Darkness!
\x7FT14391996,63785\x7FNow I just have to get my Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox, and I'll be all set!
\x7FT14455781,38441\x7FNow all I need is my superhero mask and I'll be all set!
\x7FT14494222,41577\x7FNow if I can just get my mask and my lunchbox, I'll be all set!
\x7FT14535799,13065\x7FWow, a hammer!
\x7FT14548864,9737\x7FWorks great!
\x7FT14558601,18633\x7FI can't reach it from here!
\x7FT14577234,25129\x7FOK, Darkness, watch out!

\x7FT14807233,19081\x7FLet's go back up the falls!
\x7FT14826314,21417\x7FCan we please go back up the falls?
\x7FT14847731,21609\x7FPajama Man would just fly up there.
\x7FT14869340,21449\x7FCan we please go back up the falls?
\x7FT14890789,27370\x7FI have a better idea:  let's not.
\x7FT14918159,24944\x7FAnyway, we can't get back up those falls.
\x7FT14943103,17856\x7FWe'll have to go out a different way.
\x7FT14960959,14192\x7FWe can't get up there.
\x7FT14975151,61857\x7FIf you want to come down the falls again we're going to have to go out a different way, because I can't get us up there.
\x7FT15037008,41426\x7FWell, neither of us can fly, so don't get your hopes up.
\x7FT15078434,41514\x7FIt's not up to me, it's just physically impossible for us to get up there.
\x7FT15119948,43945\x7FHey!  There's my Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox!
\x7FT15163893,15959\x7FWere we looking for that?
\x7FT15179852,33187\x7FYeah!  I need it to put Darkness in when I capture him!
\x7FT15213039,56126\x7FIt's my Portable Bad Guy Containment Unit, just like Pajama Man's.
\x7FT15269165,17866\x7FOh, I see.
\x7FT15287031,19753\x7FRats, I can't reach it.
\x7FT15306784,19141\x7FDarn, I can't reach it.
\x7FT15325925,28483\x7FI've got to get it out of there before it rusts.
\x7FT15354408,21906\x7FI thought you said it was made of metal.
\x7FT15376314,29481\x7FRight.
\x7FT15405795,39612\x7FReally ?, Well I guess you were right about the wood thing.
\x7FT15445407,88613\x7FI still can't reach it.
\x7FT15534020,14639\x7FI can't get it.
\x7FT15548659,12361\x7FI need a tool.
\x7FT15561020,27459\x7FI need to use something the lunchbox will stick to.
\x7FT15588479,16811\x7FHey, I've got an idea!
\x7FT15605290,17149\x7FWhat are you gonna do with that?
\x7FT15622439,16409\x7FMagnets attract metal, you know.
\x7FT15638848,24803\x7FOh no, I don't think they do.
\x7FT15663651,39399\x7FI had this friend, and ... Well, whaddya know!
\x7FT15703050,13800\x7FUGHHH....
\x7FT15716850,21019\x7FI got my lunchbox!
\x7FT15737869,13863\x7FAll right!
\x7FT15751732,7699\x7FYessss!
\x7FT15759431,18505\x7FWatch out, Darkness!
\x7FT15777936,26377\x7FPajama Sam is ready to roll!
\x7FT15804313,44969\x7FNow I just need my Pajama Sam mask and I can go capture Darkness!
\x7FT15849282,47017\x7FNow I just need my trusty flashlight and I can go capture Darkness!
\x7FT15896299,58153\x7FNow all I need is nire linterna and my Pajama Sam mask, and I'll be ready for action!
\x7FT9275952,21377\x7F(PU)I'll give the oars to Otto when we need them.
\x7FT9297329,28683\x7F(PU)I'll just wait and give these oars to Otto when we need them.
\x7FT9326012,15307\x7F(PU)Otto doesn't need the oars now.
\x7FT9341319,24885\x7F(PU)Otto doesn't need the oars right at this moment.

\x7FT17178561,16777\x7FMy lunchbox!
\x7FT17195338,23442\x7FWhy call it that when you can't eat it?
\x7FT17218780,8977\x7FI beg your pardon?
\x7FT17227757,53418\x7FIt seems very silly to call it a 'lunchbox' when you wouldn't dream of having it for lunch.
\x7FT17281175,21335\x7FBut your lunch goes IN it.
\x7FT17302510,22561\x7FYour lunch goes in YOU, does it not?
\x7FT17325071,32101\x7FPerhaps you would like me to call YOU 'lunchbox', as well?
\x7FT17357172,14169\x7FI'm not a box.
\x7FT17371341,15341\x7FAh, too true.
\x7FT15954452,9945\x7FMy name's Sam.
\x7FT15964397,18761\x7FWhere did you get a name like that?
\x7FT15983158,54733\x7FI didn't say it was my name, I just said you could call me that. If you want to.
\x7FT16037891,23188\x7FYou can call me 'Calnibonix.'

\x7FT16395444,19225\x7FOh. Uh, thanks.
\x7FT16414669,66017\x7FI'm going to put on my Pajama Sam mask, capture Darkness with nire linterna, and keep him in my lunchbox.
\x7FT16480686,10134\x7FThere's another thing.
\x7FT16490820,4299\x7FWhat?
\x7FT16495119,8900\x7F'Flashlight.'
\x7FT16504019,42345\x7FIt doesn't actually flash, does it? I mean, not by itself?
\x7FT16546364,16807\x7FYou're really a pain, you know that?
\x7FT16563171,24852\x7FNonsense. I'm a wishing well.
\x7FT16588023,12789\x7FOf course.
\x7FT16600812,12009\x7FWhere does that water go?
\x7FT16612821,25236\x7FWhy, into the hole, of course.
\x7FT16638057,29737\x7FAfter the water goes down the hole what happens to it?
\x7FT16667794,55582\x7FIt makes a stream underneath us, and then the bucket brings it back up again.
\x7FT16723376,37353\x7FWhy do you pour the water down the hole if you're just going to bring it up again?
\x7FT16760729,35330\x7FWe have to pour the water down the hole to make the stream.
\x7FT16796059,18009\x7FWhy do you have to make a stream?
\x7FT16814068,44618\x7FSilly. If we didn't make the stream, we wouldn't have a source of water.
\x7FT16858686,48553\x7FSo the only reason you're making this stream is so you'll have water to make the stream?
\x7FT16907239,25872\x7FWhat are you trying to do, put me out of a job?
\x7FT16933111,18377\x7FNo, it just seems sort of silly.
\x7FT16951488,34375\x7FThat's because you're not a trained professional, like me.
\x7FT16985863,9993\x7FI see.
\x7FT16995856,34575\x7FWouldn't you be even better off if you made TWO streams?
\x7FT17030431,21737\x7FThen you'd have twice as much water.
\x7FT17052168,15317\x7FExpansion, eh?
\x7FT17067485,18260\x7FThat's an interesting idea.
\x7FT17085745,18082\x7FI'll have to think about that.
\x7FT17103827,27625\x7FHave you thought about my two stream idea yet?
\x7FT17131452,47109\x7FI'm still considering all the ramifications. It's very technical.
\x7FT17386682,19081\x7FWatch out, Darkness!
\x7FT17405763,26115\x7FHere comes Pajama Sam!
\x7FT17431878,55849\x7FNow if I can just get my Pajama Sam mask I'll be ready to capture Darkness!
\x7FT17487727,43689\x7FNow if I can just get nire linterna I'll be ready to capture Darkness!
\x7FT17531416,48521\x7FNow all I need is nire linterna and my Pajama Sam mask and I'm all set!
\x7FT17579937,13673\x7FHey, pennies!
\x7FT17593610,13689\x7FI wish...
\x7FT17607299,22442\x7FI wish the grass were greener here.
\x7FT17629741,14985\x7FWhy are YOU wishing?
\x7FT17644726,13289\x7FI threw the penny in.
\x7FT17658015,20994\x7FWho's the wishing well here, you or me?
\x7FT17679009,3417\x7FOh.
\x7FT17682426,17329\x7FI wish for a penny.
\x7FT17699755,29207\x7FOh, good heavens, I've got my wish already, haven't I?
\x7FT17728962,7757\x7FThank you.
\x7FT17736719,56548\x7FI wish for a giant chicken sandwich with spicy mustard and Swiss cheese.
\x7FT17793267,28086\x7FOh, what I wouldn't do for a chicken sandwich...
\x7FT17821353,23730\x7FI wish I could see what was behind me.
\x7FT17845083,26508\x7FI wish for some peace and quiet.
\x7FT17871591,17121\x7FI wish you'd leave me be.
\x7FT17888712,22935\x7FI wish for a chicken sandwich.
\x7FT17911647,24242\x7FI wish for a big hunk of cheese.
\x7FT17935889,46722\x7FI wish that wishes were fishes so we could all eat seafood.
\x7FT17982611,47197\x7FI wish that wishes were horses so all beggars could ride.
\x7FT18029808,28882\x7FI wish you'd stop throwing away all my pennies.
\x7FT18058690,45767\x7FI wish you'd go capture Darkness and leave me alone.
\x7FT18104457,18727\x7FDon't even think about it.
\x7FT18123184,28937\x7FThat's more money than I want to be throwing down a well.

\x7FT18201547,21708\x7FThe current is too strong!

\x7FT18293938,45994\x7FIf only we had a motor, or something else to give me a little more power.
\x7FT18339932,29750\x7FYou could help too, you know. Paddle or something.
\x7FT18369682,24714\x7FI could do it if I just had some oars.
\x7FT18394396,9609\x7FYeah...
\x7FT18404005,35177\x7FHere, maybe these will help with the strong current in that stream.

\x7FT18515676,27654\x7FThese oars should help me get up this waterfall.

\x7FT18779122,10233\x7FWhat was that?
\x7FT18789355,16201\x7FWhat is that thing anyway?
\x7FT18805556,19241\x7FWhat did you say that thing was called?
\x7FT18824797,19593\x7FWhat is that thing anyway?
\x7FT18844390,11334\x7FThat's a geyser.
\x7FT18855724,10359\x7FA what?
\x7FT18866083,11944\x7FA geyser.
\x7FT18878027,42921\x7FIt's a kind of hot spring that spurts up water and steam every so often.
\x7FT18920948,26700\x7FIt works kind of like a coffee percolator.
\x7FT18947648,122637\x7FWater in passages deep down where the rocks are hot gets heated up to the point where it would normally turn into steam, except it doesn't because of the pressure of all the other water on top of it.
\x7FT19070285,58419\x7FSo it gets really hot and it expands, and it pushes some of the colder water out of the top.
\x7FT19128704,100826\x7FThat relieves the pressure, and all of a sudden, the hot water turns into steam, and POW, it erupts out, along with all the colder water on top.
\x7FT19229530,61620\x7FThen more water flows down into the deep passages and the whole thing starts all over again.
\x7FT19291150,53491\x7FMost geysers are located in Wyoming, New Zealand, or Iceland.
\x7FT19344641,67715\x7FThe word 'geyser' originated in Iceland, from their word, 'gjosa', meaning 'gush'.
\x7FT19412356,42996\x7FGeysers are usually very unpredictable about when they erupt.
\x7FT19455352,119360\x7FThe most famous exception is a geyser called 'Old Faithful' in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, which erupts every sixty-four minutes, give or take about three minutes.
\x7FT19574712,34526\x7FIt looks like this one goes off a lot more often that that.
\x7FT19609238,22553\x7FUm... Thanks a lot, Otto.

\x7FT20345420,35585\x7FLook, I'm sorry, kid, I'm just real depressed is all.
\x7FT20381005,38678\x7FSee, I used to roll all over the place on this here track.
\x7FT20419683,13588\x7F.....up, down.....
\x7FT20433271,12793\x7F.....sideways...

\x7FT20503791,8265\x7FRust?
\x7FT20512056,27435\x7FYeah, rust.
\x7FT20539491,43957\x7FSee, my wheels are rusted stiff so I'm stuck right here on this spot.
\x7FT20583448,14216\x7FCan't move at all.
\x7FT20597664,15721\x7FGee, that's too bad.
\x7FT20613385,53386\x7FYeah, especially in summer when the pigeons come down here for some shade.
\x7FT20666771,9505\x7FHow are you doing?
\x7FT20676276,30752\x7FAh, same old same old.
\x7FT20707028,22251\x7FStill rusted to the track.
\x7FT20729279,21580\x7FI wouldn't go in there on foot if I were you.
\x7FT20750859,19623\x7FHot lava and so forth.
\x7FT20770482,19835\x7FMuch too dangerous on foot.
\x7FT20790317,13550\x7FYou'll need a mine cart.
\x7FT20803867,13161\x7FYou mean like you?
\x7FT20817028,29362\x7FNo, you'll need a WORKING mine cart.
\x7FT20846390,36399\x7FMy wheels are rusted, so I can't move.
\x7FT20882789,7380\x7F*  sigh  *
\x7FT20890169,55367\x7FLook, I told you not to go in there without a mine cart, one with wheels that work.
\x7FT20945536,8573\x7F*  sigh  *
\x7FT20954109,45931\x7FI'd love to take you in there myself,...
\x7FT21000040,8592\x7FHowdy Sam.
\x7FT21008632,8121\x7FHi King.
\x7FT21016753,6057\x7FKing!
\x7FT21000040,8592\x7FHowdy Sam.
\x7FT21022810,14107\x7FThanks for the lift King.
\x7FT19908554,33561\x7FAnytime you need a ride through the mines, the King'll take you.
\x7FT21036917,8808\x7FBye, bye now.
\x7FT21045725,9036\x7FI Gotcha...
\x7FT21054761,7893\x7FBye bye.
\x7FT21062654,7739\x7FAwright...
\x7FT21054761,7893\x7FBye bye.

\x7FT21326215,35305\x7FI think this pickaxe is too big to use on those boards.
\x7FT21361520,21485\x7FMaybe I should use a smaller tool.
CHRIST!
Choke!

\x7FT21070393,25833\x7FThese boards are stuck on here pretty good.
\x7FT21096226,27704\x7FI need something to pry these boards off with.
\x7FT21123930,15577\x7FI wish I had a claw hammer.
\x7FT21139507,16202\x7FDo you think Darkness will be mad?
\x7FT21155709,27112\x7FAw, he never comes down here.
\x7FT21182821,21329\x7FLet's try to find work as a floor.
\x7FT21204150,16336\x7FDo you think we'll get any severance pay?
\x7FT21220486,28137\x7FUnngh! Unngh!
\x7FT21248623,7626\x7FYipes!
\x7FT21248623,7626\x7FYipes!
\x7FT21256249,26872\x7FWait!  We give!  Uncle! Uncle!
\x7FT21283121,24781\x7FI was tired of that job anyway.
\x7FT21307902,18313\x7FBye now!  Have a nice day.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!

\x7FT21383005,27913\x7FHow come the tracks go right up to that wall?
\x7FT21410918,12385\x7FThis is new to me.
\x7FT21423303,25476\x7FI thought these tracks went right through here.
\x7FT21448779,42474\x7FI'm positive there's more track on the other side, if we can just get through.
\x7FT21491253,11897\x7FHow do we do that?
\x7FT21503150,10168\x7FBeats me.
\x7FT21513318,21001\x7FI wish there was a passageway here.
\x7FT21534319,22807\x7FIt looks like somebody was planning one.
\x7FT21557126,15241\x7FYeah, but they didn't finish it.
\x7FT21572367,29257\x7FWhy do you think they didn't finish the passageway here?
\x7FT21601624,8554\x7FI dunno.
\x7FT21610178,43214\x7FThe Construction Crew can be pretty bad about finishing things sometimes.
\x7FT21653392,31753\x7FThis reminds me of something I saw in a cartoon once.
\x7FT21685145,44712\x7FDo you think if we finished the plan, the Construction Crew would finish the passageway?
\x7FT21729857,13034\x7FI guess it's worth a try.
\x7FT21742891,24809\x7FWe need something to draw the lines with.
\x7FT21767700,22481\x7FI remember this project.
\x7FT21790181,63321\x7FWe were working on it just before those workers mixed me up with the golf scoring pencil and left me out at the course.
\x7FT21853502,14245\x7FLet's finish the job.
\x7FT21867747,24765\x7FLet's finish this job once and for all.
\x7FT21892512,9487\x7FChim Chim!
\x7FT21901999,27028\x7FBoy, am I glad to see you guys!
\x7FT21929027,15856\x7FWhoops, gotta go.
\x7FT21944883,19971\x7FIt's been great working with you, kid!
\x7FT21964854,37731\x7FNow, that's a fine piece of work if I must say so my...
\x7FT22002585,42472\x7FBert!  There you are!  I thought we'd lost you for good!
\x7FT22045057,18729\x7FYeah, uh, bye bye!
\x7FT22063786,88303\x7FToo long to display!
\x7FT22152089,28873\x7FI think this rock is too hard for me to get through.
\x7FT22180962,20060\x7FThis is a job for professionals.
\x7FT22201022,26695\x7FThis is a job for the Construction Crew.
\x7FT22227717,38666\x7FMaybe if I finish drawing the plans they will come and finish making the door.
\x7FT22266383,22215\x7FI don't think we can get back out that way.
\x7FT22288598,25457\x7FThat's too high, we can't get back up there.
\x7FT22314055,29164\x7FWe can't go back that way, we'll have to take the other way out.
\x7FT22343219,17017\x7FI don't think we can get up there.

\x7FT22454321,39029\x7FI'm a little rusty at this, you're going to have to help me out.
\x7FT22493350,21148\x7FI hope you know your numbers...
\x7FT22514498,21271\x7FLooks like you'll need to go in order.
\x7FT22535769,24716\x7FLooks like you'll need to count by twos.
\x7FT22560485,26667\x7FLooks like you'll need to count by threes.
\x7FT22587152,25112\x7FLooks like you'll need to count by tens.
\x7FT22360236,12937\x7FI'll start at 1.
\x7FT22373173,11289\x7FI'll start at 2.
\x7FT22384462,11401\x7FI'll start at 3.
\x7FT22395863,11881\x7FI'll start at 10.
\x7FT22407744,24276\x7FEh, that doesn't look quite right.
\x7FT22432020,22301\x7FLet me erase it and we'll try again.
\x7FT22612264,24477\x7FI don't know if that was the next number.
\x7FT22636741,22438\x7FI don't think that's the next number.
\x7FT22659179,25383\x7FI'm not too sure about that line.
\x7FT22684562,29272\x7FRemember, we're supposed to go in order.
\x7FT22713834,31130\x7FRemember, we're supposed to go by twos
\x7FT22744964,32917\x7FRemember, we're supposed to go in threes.

I said no, damn your eyes!
\x7FT23115977,34936\x7FAaaahh - I wish I had nire linterna.
\x7FT23150913,26944\x7FWhoa, it's dark in here!
\x7FT23177857,19588\x7FWho turned out the lights?
\x7FT23197445,19434\x7F(PU)I can't see where we're going!
\x7FT23598149,10687\x7FThat tickles.
\x7FT23608836,24700\x7FThat tickles. Hee Hee Hee!
\x7FT23216879,26980\x7FYou'll have to unhook me if you want to discuss the flashlight.
\x7FT23243859,39466\x7FI can't discuss the flashlight when I'm attached to the rope.
\x7FT23283325,32803\x7FHey nire linterna.  I wonder how we can get it?
\x7FT23316128,62762\x7FIf we can get up enough speed we might be able to jump right onto the top track and get that flashlight.
\x7FT23378890,61655\x7FIf we can get up enough speed we might be able to jump right onto the top track and get that flashlight.
\x7FT23440545,17929\x7FI guess it's worth a try.
\x7FT23458474,39113\x7FSo you think if we can just get going fast enough we can get to the flashlight?
\x7FT23497587,7551\x7FRight.
\x7FT23505138,41513\x7FHow can we get going fast enough to make the jump up to where the flashlight is?
\x7FT23546651,30314\x7FWell, we could start at the top of a steep hill.
\x7FT23576965,8871\x7FThanks.
\x7FT23585836,12313\x7FThere, you're free.
\x7FT23633536,25577\x7FIt's a hook attached to that winch up there.
\x7FT23659113,26089\x7FIt's a hook attached to that thing up there.
\x7FT23685202,28425\x7FIt's not much use until we get the winch fixed.
\x7FT23713627,24969\x7FIt's a hook attached to that thing up there.
no enter costume for room %d
\x7FT23738596,26983\x7FWe can't go that way with this rope attached to me.
\x7FT23765579,33217\x7FYou'll have to unhook this rope from me before we can go that way.
\x7FT23798796,11881\x7FHey, look at that!
\x7FT23810677,14627\x7FThat's nire linterna!
\x7FT23825304,20489\x7FIt is!  It is nire linterna!
\x7FT23845793,28745\x7FAha!  I thought that was nire linterna!
\x7FT23874538,17366\x7FHey, it's nire linterna!
\x7FT23810677,14627\x7FThat's nire linterna!
\x7FT24798079,25789\x7FThe winch doesn't need oiling, it needs a new gear.
\x7FT24798079,25789\x7FThe winch doesn't need oiling, it needs a new gear.
\x7FT23891904,18249\x7FI'd better go get a different gear.
\x7FT23910153,20118\x7FThis gear is the wrong shape.
\x7FT23930271,15665\x7FI don't think it'll work.
\x7FT23945936,31191\x7FI guess I should have attached this to something first.
\x7FT23977127,27547\x7FThere's only one way down now, so hop in.
\x7FT24004674,21271\x7FOh no, you're not leaving me here.

\x7FT24025945,13309\x7FWhat is it?
\x7FT24039254,15745\x7FIt's an old winch.
\x7FT24054999,49309\x7FI bet if I hauled you up here with it, we could get going fast enough to get the flashlight.
\x7FT24104308,48602\x7FI bet if I hauled you up here with it, we could get going fast enough to get the flashlight.
\x7FT24152910,41297\x7FI bet if I hauled you up here with it, we could get up some real speed!

\x7FT24249088,20782\x7FWell, I think it's broken.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT24269870,57863\x7FIf we just fix this winch, I can use it to haul you up here and get us going really fast.
\x7FT24327733,24212\x7FI think this needs to connect to...
\x7FT24351945,11591\x7F...that somehow.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT24363536,19301\x7FI think there's a piece missing.
\x7FT24382837,26873\x7FIt looks like there should be one more gear here.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT24409710,27429\x7FI think this gear is the wrong shape.

\x7FT24437139,20261\x7FAll right, it's working!

\x7FT24512714,30544\x7FI guess I should have attached the hook to King first.
\x7FT24543258,18730\x7FHey, don't you want to get in?
\x7FT24561988,7385\x7FOh yeah.
\x7FT24569373,24426\x7FHold it! You better get in before you do that.
\x7FT24593799,20714\x7FHold it! You better get in before you unhook me.
\x7FT24614513,15863\x7FBut it looks dangerous.
\x7FT24630376,26240\x7FExactly, I'm not doing it by myself.
\x7FT24656616,20180\x7FYou'd better climb in before you release that.
\x7FT24676796,19133\x7FYou'd better climb in before you unhook me.
\x7FT24695929,24363\x7FHold it! Get in, I'm not doing this alone.
Don't use to-the-void on selected-actor!!
\x7FT24720292,12706\x7FHere we go.

\x7FT24764838,18226\x7FI don't think that was quite right.
\x7FT24783064,15015\x7FNo, I don't think so.
\x7FT24823868,9161\x7FI flipped it!
\x7FT24833029,15609\x7FI got it!  I got it!
\x7FT24848638,12441\x7FWe did it!
\x7FT24861079,16585\x7FWe got the flashlight.
\x7FT24877664,46761\x7FNow all I need is my mask and my lunchbox and I'll be ready for Darkness.
\x7FT24924425,37128\x7FNow all I need is my mask and I'll be ready for Darkness.
\x7FT24961553,67113\x7FNow all I need is my Signature Edition All-Metal Pajama Man lunchbox and I'll be ready for Darkness.
\x7FT25028666,23241\x7FDarkness is in big trouble.
\x7FT25051907,22921\x7FI'll bet that was nire linterna back there!

\x7FT25074828,40297\x7FI bet if I reached for the switch when I jump out of the cart, I could flip it.

\x7FT25115125,20457\x7FIt's some kind of a big switch.
\x7FT25135582,15545\x7FIt's switched on right now.
\x7FT25151127,15401\x7FIt's switched off right now.
\x7FT25166528,33225\x7FThat's the second biggest switch I've ever seen.
\x7FT25199753,18153\x7FI wonder what it controls.
\x7FT25217906,25545\x7FThat switch must turn on the lights in the other room.
\x7FT25243451,32617\x7FI wish the light switch in my bedroom looked like that one.
\x7FT25276068,30878\x7FI wonder if this is the light switch for those dark rooms.
\x7FT25306946,35257\x7FI bet that switch will turn on the lights back in those dark rooms.
\x7FT25342203,11193\x7FIt's switched on.
\x7FT25353396,13065\x7FIt's switched off.
\x7FT25366461,16057\x7FLet's go back up that way!
\x7FT25382518,29514\x7FNo can do, my friend.
\x7FT25412032,16425\x7FLet's go back up that way!
\x7FT25428457,15994\x7FWe can't get up there.
\x7FT25444451,19129\x7FCan we please go back up there?
\x7FT25463580,30398\x7FI'm telling you, we can't do it, it's impossible.
\x7FT25493978,21609\x7FCan we please go back up that way?
\x7FT25515587,39148\x7FIt's not up to me, it's just physically impossible for us to get up there.

\x7FT25564200,31143\x7FI can't reach it, and there's hot lava all around it.
\x7FT25595343,27239\x7FMaybe I can find a tool that will help me get the nail.
\x7FT25622582,17023\x7FI can't reach that nail.
\x7FT25639605,15599\x7FAll right, I got the nail.
\x7FT25655204,12470\x7FPretty slick.

\x7FT25891504,15145\x7FLet's go for a ride!

\x7FT25930225,12716\x7FWhat are you gonna do with that?
\x7FT25942941,8695\x7FYou'll see.
\x7FT25951636,20415\x7FOK, but be careful with it.
\x7FT25972051,17353\x7FBy the way what is this thing?
\x7FT25989404,14409\x7FBy the way what is it?
\x7FT26003813,30916\x7FIt's a pickax, for mining gold and other good stuff.
\x7FT26034729,5641\x7FOh yeah.
\x7FT26040370,32233\x7FI'm not going over there.  That's hot lava!
\x7FT26072603,49769\x7FIt's too dangerous to walk over there on foot with this lava all over the place.
\x7FT26122372,41193\x7FNo way am I walking on those tiny tracks around all this lava.
\x7FT26163565,49001\x7FMaybe if I help that mine cart who's rusted to the track he'd give me a lift through here.
\x7FT26212566,36425\x7FThese tracks are kind of skinny for me to be walking on.
\x7FT26248991,14633\x7FI wonder what they're for?
\x7FT26263624,26441\x7FThere's nowhere on this door to attach a doorknob.
\x7FT26290065,19609\x7FThere's nothing there to stick it on to.
\x7FT26309674,25641\x7FMaybe there's a handle on the other side.
\x7FT26335315,27690\x7FDon't even bother, kid, it's a one way door.
\x7FT26363005,46148\x7FNo use in trying, kid, there's no way to open it from this side.
\x7FT26409153,41779\x7FIt's a one-way door - you have to open it from the other side.
\x7FT26335315,27690\x7FDon't even bother, kid, it's a one way door.

\x7FT26450932,19337\x7FHey, Sam, how'd you get down this way?

\x7FT26593321,27169\x7FWow! This must be gold!
\x7FT26620490,28073\x7FI'd take some more but my pickaxe is broken.
\x7FT26648563,11593\x7FWhy be greedy?
\x7FT26660156,17257\x7FI've got plenty of gold already.
\x7FT26677413,21705\x7FGold is really heavy.
\x7FT26699118,44329\x7FI don't know why people seem to like it so much when it's so hard to carry around.
\x7FT26743447,61198\x7FI don't know about you but I'd rather have a golden nugget of cheddar cheese than a golden nugget of gold.
\x7FT26804645,13094\x7FHey, who wouldn't?
\x7FT26817739,27753\x7FI've got to find something to mine that out of there with.
\x7FT26845492,21513\x7FI can't get a very good grip on it.
\x7FT26867005,22377\x7FI need some kind of a mining tool.
\x7FT26889382,10964\x7FGold!
\x7FT26900346,11210\x7FIt sure is.
\x7FT26911556,14809\x7FI can't get it out of there.
\x7FT26926365,23274\x7FYou'll have to find something to mine it with.
\x7FT26949639,16185\x7FI warned you to be careful.
\x7FT26965824,25903\x7FYeah, But look at all this gold I got!
\x7FT26991727,41162\x7FSince you're fabulously rich, how about sharing the wealth a little?
\x7FT27032889,22259\x7FSay, let me have the small piece? 
\x7FT27055148,4931\x7FDeal.
\x7FT22266383,22215\x7FI don't think we can get back out that way.
\x7FT22288598,25457\x7FThat's too high, we can't get back up there.
\x7FT22314055,29164\x7FWe can't go back that way, we'll have to take the other way out.
\x7FT27060079,17529\x7FI think I need something sharper.
\x7FT27077608,24201\x7FI think I need something like a pickax.
\x7FT27101809,19881\x7FI think I'd need something bigger.
\x7FT27121690,23390\x7FI think I need to use a mining tool.
\x7FT27145080,24201\x7FIt says 'Remote Mining Terminal.'
\x7FT27169281,14377\x7FThat was fun.
\x7FT27183658,28351\x7FThat there is a Remote Mining Terminal.
\x7FT27212009,15210\x7FTry it out, it's fun.
\x7FT27227219,18473\x7FAll right, Nuggets!
\x7FT27245692,18441\x7FTime to play Nuggets!
\x7FT27264133,22857\x7FNuggets is the best game ever!
\x7FT27286990,16025\x7FLooks like a game to me...
\x7FT27303015,34377\x7FThis looks like the control panel for some kind of robot!
\x7FT27337392,18633\x7FIt's just like a video game.
\x7FT27356025,42566\x7FYou're supposed to pick up the nuggets without crashing into anything, including yourself.
\x7FT27398591,21229\x7FWatch out for the moving rocks and the hot lava.
\x7FT22266383,22215\x7FI don't think we can get back out that way.
\x7FT22314055,29164\x7FWe can't go back that way, we'll have to take the other way out.

\x7FT27419820,29929\x7FYep, this is Darkness's house all right.
\x7FT27449749,35944\x7FThese baskets must be the way up into Darkness's House.
\x7FT27485693,29833\x7FThat basket must be lighter than the one on the ground.
\x7FT27515526,24873\x7FI bet it would come down if it weighed more.
\x7FT27540399,33941\x7FMaybe I could throw something heavy into it to weigh it down.
\x7FT27574340,13501\x7FThese are pretty heavy.

\x7FT27747070,32521\x7FI'd better find a way to get up into Darkness's treehouse.
\x7FT27779591,26409\x7FThis is it!  The fortress of the enemy!
\x7FT27806000,28136\x7FLet's get in there and rescue the troops.
\x7FT27834136,12217\x7FOK.
\x7FT27846353,12860\x7FThere's no mail.
\x7FT27859213,4473\x7FBeat it.
\x7FT27863686,31842\x7FWell, all right, there's a little mail, but it's all for Darkness.
\x7FT27895528,12805\x7FAnd it's all bills.
\x7FT27908333,15398\x7FYou don't want what's in here.

\x7FT28017525,9829\x7FYeah, right.
\x7FT28027354,16543\x7FIt says 'Rocks.'
\x7FT28043897,30751\x7FLooks like Darkness isn't a very good speller.
\x7FT28074648,14675\x7FHey, rocks.
\x7FT28089323,29319\x7FMy rope's not long enough to help me get into the treehouse.

\x7FT47205320,30089\x7FRoaming the streets disguised as dill pickles.

\x7FT46535440,17417\x7FWorms don't have heads.
\x7FT46552857,24490\x7FGreat choice!  You are correct.
\x7FT46577347,4477\x7FOne.
\x7FT46581824,31592\x7FI'm sorry, that's not the correct answer.
\x7FT46613416,24810\x7FWorms don't have heads.
\x7FT46638226,4913\x7FTwo.
\x7FT46643139,18344\x7FI don't think so.
\x7FT46661483,37344\x7FYou see, worms don't have heads.
\x7FT46698827,10617\x7FWhat do I care?
\x7FT46709444,13468\x7FThat's right!
\x7FT46722912,41458\x7FA worm is a worm, no matter if it has a head or not.
\x7FT51244850,35517\x7FWhat's so great about Earthworms?
\x7FT46764370,17417\x7FThey are very smart.
\x7FT46781787,42233\x7FOh yes, Earthworms ARE smart.  Good answer.
\x7FT46824020,32457\x7FThey stimulate microbial populations.
\x7FT46856477,26602\x7FYes they do.  You are correct.
\x7FT46883079,16681\x7FWho ever said they're great?
\x7FT46899760,34026\x7FI don't know.  That makes you correct!
\x7FT46933786,28361\x7FThey are wonderful performance artists.
\x7FT46962147,37216\x7FI'm sorry but that answer is incorrect.
\x7FT46999363,49971\x7FEarthworms are great because they stimulate microbial populations.
\x7FT51280367,28136\x7FWho painted the Mona Lisa?
\x7FT47344995,15417\x7FLeonardo DaVinci.
\x7FT47360412,61554\x7FCorrect!  This Italian artist painted the Mona Lisa in the early 1500's.
\x7FT47421966,20265\x7FJolly Old St. Nick.
\x7FT47442231,48352\x7FI'm sorry.  He may have delivered it, but he sure didn't paint it.
\x7FT47490583,21905\x7FLeonardo DaVinci did.
\x7FT47512488,7081\x7FI did.
\x7FT47519569,14246\x7FNo you didn't.
\x7FT47533815,19209\x7FHieronymus Bosch.
\x7FT47553024,52286\x7FOh, no.  Hieronymus Bosch was a 15th century Dutch painter.
\x7FT47605310,33579\x7FThe correct answer is 'Leonardo DaVinci.'
\x7FT51308503,24050\x7FWhat do most people paint with?
\x7FT47843391,10841\x7FFinger Paints.
\x7FT47854232,15154\x7FPerhaps in your world.
\x7FT47869386,26891\x7FTherefore, you are correct!
\x7FT47896277,11080\x7FPaint Brushes.
\x7FT47922517,10153\x7FComputers.
\x7FT47907357,15160\x7FGood choice!
\x7FT47939774,55766\x7FI am sure some have employed broccoli as a painting tool, but not most people.
\x7FT47995540,40453\x7FThe anwer we were looking for was 'Paint Brushes.'
\x7FT51332553,42922\x7FHow did Michelangelo paint the ceiling of the Sistene Chapel?
\x7FT47638889,12089\x7FOn his back.
\x7FT47650978,23203\x7FYes he did.  Good choice!
\x7FT47674181,15161\x7FVery carefully.
\x7FT47689342,32494\x7FSimple but true.  You are correct.
\x7FT47721836,27369\x7FMichelangelo didn't paint the Sistene Chapel.
\x7FT47749205,22442\x7FI must admit he did.
\x7FT47771647,21769\x7FWith a little help from his friends.
\x7FT51375475,35992\x7FThe correct answer is 'On his back'.
\x7FT47793416,49975\x7FYes, he got by with a little help from his friends.  Good answer.
\x7FT51411467,72762\x7FIn 1990, Vincent Van Gogh's 'Portrait of Dr. Gachet' sold for how much money?
\x7FT48035993,33609\x7F$82.5 million.
\x7FT48069602,47274\x7FYes indeed!  And that price didn't even include sales tax!
\x7FT48116876,22697\x7FAn Arm and a Leg and an Ear.
\x7FT48139573,55987\x7FClever, but the correct answer is $82.5 million.
\x7FT48195560,9113\x7FA lot.
\x7FT48204673,67393\x7FCorrect.  The painting sold for a lot, $82.5 million to be exact.
\x7FT48272066,21481\x7FMore than I could make at a paper route.
\x7FT48293547,44331\x7FYes, that's true, much more than you'd ever make at a paper route.
\x7FT51484229,39299\x7FOh my gosh, Darkness must be right behind this door!

\x7FT51914682,28011\x7FHi! I'm Pajama Sam. I've come to..
\x7FT51942693,49976\x7FWait, don't tell me, let me guess:  you're here to defeat Darkness, right?
\x7FT51992669,11421\x7FHow did you know that?
\x7FT52004090,16464\x7FSeen it before, boy.
\x7FT52020554,18053\x7FYou mean I'm not the first one?
\x7FT52038607,18328\x7FOoh, heavens, no.
\x7FT52056935,4453\x7FOh.
\x7FT52061388,29529\x7FHave there been... a LOT of kids here before me?
\x7FT52090917,20728\x7FSeems like a lot, yes.
\x7FT52111645,20234\x7FCourse I've been here a long time.
\x7FT52131879,19304\x7FA real long time.
\x7FT52151183,31761\x7FDid they have cable television when you were first built?
\x7FT52182944,24143\x7FOh, no, I'm much older than that.
\x7FT52207087,28099\x7FWhat about cars? Were there cars when you were built?
\x7FT52235186,26157\x7FNope, there weren't even cars then.
\x7FT52261343,35849\x7FWhat about wheels? Had wheels been invented when you were built?
\x7FT52297192,12235\x7FThat's not funny.
\x7FT52309427,42980\x7FOf course there were wheels then, otherwise how could I have all these gears?
\x7FT52352407,35757\x7FWhat happened to all the other kids who came here to defeat Darkness?
\x7FT52388164,111546\x7FI don't rightly know. Grown up now, I expect. I recall there was one little girl, got herself elected to Congress in California or something like that.
\x7FT52499710,3817\x7FOh.
\x7FT52503527,13569\x7FWhat do people call you?
\x7FT52517096,52651\x7FHardly anyone ever does call me, but those that do just call me Grampa.
\x7FT52569747,15521\x7FWhat's new, Grampa?
\x7FT52585268,10247\x7FThere's a new minute.
\x7FT52595515,42192\x7FI'm just enjoying it while I can, before the next one comes along.
\x7FT52637707,17431\x7FLike those gears, do you?
\x7FT52655138,13023\x7FThey're really great!
\x7FT52668161,63146\x7FTell you what, I'll let you have any one you want if you'll set my hands to the correct time for me.
\x7FT52731307,6445\x7FOkay!
\x7FT52737752,20439\x7FExcept I don't know what time it is.
\x7FT52758191,59172\x7FWell, maybe you could ask one of the younger clocks around here, they'd probably know, the little smart alecs.
\x7FT52817363,11953\x7FOK, I'll do that.
\x7FT52829316,13499\x7FCould I get another gear?
\x7FT52842815,29545\x7FI'm afraid I can really only spare one.
\x7FT52872360,19945\x7FCould I please get another gear?
\x7FT52892305,29572\x7FNo, but I'll trade you for the one you've got already.
\x7FT52921877,21381\x7FI'm not sure I picked the best gear.
\x7FT52943258,34056\x7FIf you want you can put that one back and take a different one.
\x7FT52977314,60238\x7FYou know, you can have any one of those you want if you'll just set my hands to the correct time for me.
\x7FT53037552,18293\x7F(PU)I'd like a gear, but I still don't know what time it is.
\x7FT53055845,33450\x7FLook around, you'll probably find another clock that knows.
\x7FT53089295,5401\x7FOK.
\x7FT53094696,28876\x7FYou go ahead and pick out a gear for yourself now.

\x7FT53161241,31681\x7FI'd like to try to set the time for you so I can get a gear.
\x7FT53192922,16285\x7FThanks for the gear, Grampa!

\x7FT53232357,28551\x7FI'd like to trade you this gear for a different one.
\x7FT53260908,8650\x7FAll righty.
\x7FT53269558,14493\x7FI don't think he'd like that.
\x7FT53284051,30414\x7FHow are you enjoying that gear I gave you, son?
\x7FT53314465,11365\x7FUm, it's great.
\x7FT53325830,9235\x7FIt's really great.
\x7FT53335065,9718\x7FThat's good.
\x7FT53344783,29506\x7FI'd let you trade it for a different one, if you wanted.
\x7FT53374289,23626\x7FNo no, son, no more gears.
\x7FT53397915,18424\x7FI don't have any more to spare.
\x7FT53416339,29441\x7FSorry, son, I can't spare another gear.
\x7FT53445780,17991\x7FWhat'd you do with the one I gave you?
\x7FT53463771,18903\x7FI used it to get nire linterna.
\x7FT53482674,11791\x7FFlashlight, eh?
\x7FT53494465,48379\x7FWait, don't tell me, you're going to use that flashlight to defeat Darkness, right?
\x7FT53542844,18111\x7FHow do you know so much?
\x7FT53560955,36442\x7FI'm old and wise, my boy, old and wise.

\x7FT53677260,10888\x7FThank you, son.
\x7FT53688148,28026\x7FYou go ahead and pick out a gear for yourself now.
\x7FT53716174,12447\x7FOK, that should do it.
\x7FT53728621,8755\x7FHmm.
\x7FT53737376,13061\x7FThat feels funny.
\x7FT53750437,25469\x7FI don't think you've got the time right.

\x7FT54483051,27817\x7FI couldn't even jump up to the chandelier from here...

\x7FT57672727,25194\x7FYou're pretty bizarre for a candle.
\x7FT57697921,53487\x7FWords sound really interesting when you think of them as just being sounds.
\x7FT57751408,7344\x7FWhatever.

\x7FT58276988,16063\x7FWhat a rush.
\x7FT58293051,8739\x7FNo kidding.
\x7FT58301790,27871\x7FIt could be worse.  You could be a firecracker.
\x7FT58329661,19842\x7FYou've just got to get into it.
\x7FT58349503,41653\x7FLike I gotta be reminded that my head's melting all over the place.
\x7FT58391156,55276\x7FI'm glad to see you're enjoying yourself while providing a valuable public service.
\x7FT58446432,55466\x7FSometimes my wick pops, and a second later there's a really distinctive smell...
\x7FT58501898,31116\x7FI can't stand that feeling. It gives me the willies.
\x7FT58533014,12756\x7FThat's what we're here for.
\x7FT58231365,8170\x7FWhatever.

\x7FT58604783,37428\x7FAnd when the wax dribbles down my back -- whoo!
\x7FT58642211,33128\x7FYou're burning up, wax for brains. We all are.

\x7FT58692341,12971\x7FSo we heard.
\x7FT58705312,20186\x7FOh, be quiet, would you?
\x7FT58725498,14628\x7FWhat a great strip!
\x7FT58740126,15434\x7FQuite a few times.
\x7FT58755560,22372\x7FMore often than I care to remember.
\x7FT58777932,64712\x7FDid I tell you guys about the one where the dog comes over for dinner wearing a toupee?
\x7FT58842644,48580\x7FThat strip's pretty dull, but you can balance the plush toys really easily.
\x7FT58891224,28390\x7FSo I can't say as I trust your judgement.
\x7FT58919614,12782\x7FI really love it.

\x7FT55105285,33225\x7FYep, there's definitely something on the other side of the door.
